# Running YOLOv8 Object Detection with ONNX and OpenVINO

In this demo, we'll perform object detection leveraging YOLOv8 with Ultralytics, and with ONNX using the OpenVINO Execution Provider for enhanced performance, to detect up to 80 different objects (e.g., birds, dogs, etc.)
This sample was modified from one of the [available Onnx Runtime Inference examples here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-inference-examples/tree/main/python/OpenVINO_EP/yolov8_object_detection).
